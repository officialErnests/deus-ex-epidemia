Effects:
    (Universal)
        Modify Variable: Lets you modify the variable of a card
            Note: I want to implement a global card whose variables can be modified, so i don't have to overwrite everything for the global variables. 
            Required Arguments:
                Target: 
    (Shop Only)
        Target: chooses one creature via the targetting UI, and assigns them a variable. 
            Note: if no card exists that can be targeted, negates the effect. 
            Required Arguments:
                Assign Variable[string]: What variable is assigned to the target, (and saved in the memory)
            Optional Arguments:
                Global [int]: Adding this argument means that the card gets saved in global variables and not in the cards variables. 
                    NOTE: This saves the spot at the target place as the target variable, and can therefore override global variables
                Target Filter[dict]: Allows you to filter only which kind of cards can be used.
                    Arguments:
                        Location[string]: What the cards location must be (will be explained later, but for now "On Field" is the players board, and that's all there is to it)
                        Type[int]: The type that the target card needs to be
                        Tribe[string]: the type that the target card must have
                        {unimplemented / untested}
                        Name[string]: all creatures matching the name provided
                        Count[int]: the maximum ammount of creatures that can be targeted.
