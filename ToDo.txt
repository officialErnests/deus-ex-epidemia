So, let's start making a concrete plan

The ability to play a card.
Effect stack
Resource counter, or an overseer card, that looks over all of the game values. 
It could work, but i think i better make a whole new object for that. 
Perhaps something in the game variable. 

Today, i need to make it so that there is a battle phase, where cards can attack other cards. 

#Var - global variable

@var - scene specific variable (attacker and defender mid battle)
    @Attacker - card that attacks during attack
    @Defender - card that is attacked during attack`
    @Parent - card that is using the effect
!var - card parent's variable


String.substr(1)

#Actually no, fuck that old stuff, if you save to a variable, unless you specify it to be a global one, by putting a # before it, it'll be a local one
