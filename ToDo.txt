So, let's start making a concrete plan

The ability to play a card.
Effect stack
Resource counter, or an overseer card, that looks over all of the game values. 
It could work, but i think i better make a whole new object for that. 
Perhaps something in the game variable. 

Today, i need to make it so that there is a battle phase, where cards can attack other cards. 

#Var - global variable
%Var - in card.variable
